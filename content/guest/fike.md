Hello!!! I’m Fernando Ike and also known as fike. I’m on road in the IT road a far away, since internet was access using modem 14.4k. I had have many roles (manager, sysadmin, pseudo-developer, etc.) in the IT and now I’m StackPath Solution Engineer.

I contributed in some Opensource projects like Debian, PostgreSQL and Zabbix. Nowadays, my interests are relate how to transform low performance to high performance companies and people. So, it means that Devops, SRE, Agile, Lean and Toyota Production System are my study goal. Also, I’m containerholic, co-host of Docker Sao Paulo Meetup and podcast Na Estrada DevOps (only portuguese)
