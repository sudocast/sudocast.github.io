Developer who loves to write beautiful codes. PyLadies and Django Girls member. Addicted to data science, I've already participated in projects like hacking the genome code or researching tweets with NLP and Python. Today I'm working as data scientist and developer at NUVEO and as consultant and lecturer (pro bono) for Operação Serenata de Amor. In my free time, I cultivate red curls and add movie trailers to the never ending 'to watch' movie collection.
