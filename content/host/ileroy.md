I'm a developer with +10 years of experience, I started my career as a web developer through languages and frameworks like PHP, Zope/Plone, J2EE, Ruby on Rails and Django.

In those 10 years I worked as web developer, full stack programmer and team leader, where I had interesting experiences like teaching workshops, lecturing on events and helping to organize Meetups in my local Python community.

I currently working Home Office, writing APIs, architecting micro services and dealing with large databases, which is why I have studied a lot of topics around Data Science and Machine Learning.
